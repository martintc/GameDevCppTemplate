# GameDevCppTemplate

Just a little template I am putting together to speed up some of my own
development and experimentation. This tech stack is GLFW and OpenGL. Currently,
this template has macOS in mind since this is my primary development machine at
home.

# Folder Structure

- *include*: contains header files
- *resources*: resources for the game/program such as image assets or map files
- *src*: source files, these should be the cpp/c files.
- *thirdparty*: this is where source for thirdparty libraries go (i.e glfw)
